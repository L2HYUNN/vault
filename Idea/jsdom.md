### JSDom
`jsdom`은 Node 환경에서 DOM과 같은 웹 브라우저 환경을 시물레이션 할 수 있는 도구이다.


JSdom is a pure JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. It essentially simulates a web browser's environment, allowing you to run JavaScript code in Node.js as if it were running in a real browser. This capability is particularly useful for testing web pages and JavaScript applications without the need for a browser, performing web scraping, or any server-side DOM operations.

Here's how JSdom simplifies complex tasks into manageable steps:

1. **Installation and Setup:** To use JSdom, you first need to install it via npm, Node.js's package manager. This step involves running a simple command in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Creating a Virtual DOM:** Once JSdom is installed, you can create a virtual DOM window. This window simulates the browser window, including the document object model (DOM), allowing you to interact with it using standard JavaScript and DOM API methods.

3. **Manipulation and Interaction:** With a virtual DOM, you can manipulate the HTML content, modify element styles, respond to user events, and more. This interaction mimics what happens in a real browser but is executed in a Node.js environment.

4. **Testing Web Applications:** JSdom is particularly useful for testing web applications. It allows developers to write tests that interact with the DOM, check the existence of elements, validate the application's behavior in response to events, and perform other tasks that would typically require a browser.

5. **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** For applications built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, JSdom can be used to pre-render pages on the server. This process improves the performance and SEO of single-page applications by serving static HTML to the browser, which then becomes dynamic once the client-side JavaScript takes over.

6. **Web Scraping:** JSdom can be used to programmatically navigate web pages, extract information, and perform actions as if a real user were browsing the site. This is useful for automated testing, data extraction, and automation tasks.

JSdom provides a powerful toolset for developers to interact with a web-like environment programmatically, enhancing testing capabilities, server-side utilities, and more, without the overhead or complexity of running a full browser in the server environment.
